  ## Description

  This project uses `Express.js`, `Mongoose` and the `Javascript date library` to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friend list. The app has the following capabilities:

 * entering the command to invoke the application starts the server and syncs the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database
 * opening API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts display data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON
 * testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia successfully creates, updates, and deletes users and thoughts in the database
 * testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia successfully creates and deletes reactions to thoughts and adds and removes friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
